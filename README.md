The idea behind this project is to create a tool which checks if a
server with Apache v 2.2 is configured to meet the requirements of the 
DISA STIG guide for Apache. 

The offical STIG can be found at the DISA website here:
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/ncp/repository/checklistDetail?id=351

The list of requirements this tool will be checking can be found here:

This is a personal project, but if anyone else is interested in working with me for fun,
send me an email here: mfeneley@vt.edu

I am also writing similar tools that check the configuration of linux operting systems.
If think this sounds like something you might like to work on, let me know.
